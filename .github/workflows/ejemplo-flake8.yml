# This is a basic workflow to help you implement flake8, tool that will help you to
# check your code base against coding style (PEP8), programming errors 
# (like “library imported but unused” and “Undefined name”) and to check cyclomatic complexity.

# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
   branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
